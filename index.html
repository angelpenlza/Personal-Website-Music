                <h2>About Tyler, the Creator</h2>
                <p>Tyler, the Creator got his start in about 2007, along with a group he formed known
                    as Odd Future. The group consisted of many people, too many to list them all, but some 
                    of the main ones include Frank Ocean, Earl Sweatshirt, Syd, Domo Genesis, Hodgy Beats, 
                    Taco, and Jasper Dolpin. They were a group of creative youung people, who made their 
                    own music, had their own fashion line, and had their own TV show on Adult Swim. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tyler's early music was very vulgar and problematic, which is where he got the attention
                    of a lot of people back then. His lyrics were very dark and controversial, even getting 
                    him banned from the UK at one point. But one of his greatest attributes is his ability 
                    to grow not only as a musician, but as a person in general. Throughout his discography,
                    you can see him slowly get better at what he does and more comfortable writing more
                    meaningful lyrics. Each album has its own personality and showcases Tyler's incredible
                    creatitivy. 
                </p>
                <h2>My Opinions</h2>
                <p>
                    My personal favorite Tyler, the Creator song is Okaga, CA, from his 2015 Cherry Bomb album. 
                    This album was like his transition album, where he was slowly straying away from his 
                    edgy lyrics and rapping and getting into singing and producing. It was his first album 
                    of this style, so many people do not like it as much, as it comes off as messy and unpolished, 
                    but I personally really like it, flaws and all. Okaga, CA is the last song on the album, and
                    it's a very mellow song that describes his feelings for someone, and his desire to run away 
                    from everything with them to be together. 
                </p>

                <h1>Kanye West</h1>
                <img src="yeezy2004.jpg" alt="yeezy">
                <h2>About Kanye West</h2>
                <p>
                    It is difficult to talk about Kanye West after his heavy controversy earlier this year. It was very disappointing
                    to hear him talk about what he did, and by pointing out his artistic abilites, I am in no way excusing what he said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kanye West began producing beats for many popular rappers in the 1990s, including one of the most significant 
                    rappers of all time, Jay-Z. He would later become an independent artisit use his producition abilities to create 
                    his first album, College Dropout. Kanye was one of the biggest and most influential artists of the 2000s, 
                    changing the way that hip-hop and rap was seen to the public. He introduced a lot of autotune singing and 
                    very unique production and his albums would go on to break many records. 
                </p>
                <h2>My Opinions</h2>
                <p>
                    My personal favorite album is My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasty because of the incredible production. 
                    That album had so much care put into it and so many collaborations and features that I can't even begin to 
                    mention them all. For this album, Kanye West flew to Hawaii after receiving much backlash for many things
                    he had done at the time. It was here that he worked nonstop on the album, collabortating with many producers 
                    and artists to create this recordbreaking album. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my favorite Kanye West song, I couldn't decide between Runaway, from MBDTF or Ghost Town, from ye. 
                    I decided to go with Ghost Town today, but my opinion on this will probably change depending on my mood.
                    Both songs are incredible, but I went with Ghost Town because of the phenomenal Kid Cudi feature.

                <h2>About Mac Miller</h2>
                <p>
                    Mac Miller was a rapper who started making music around the late 2000s, with his first studio album being K.I.D.S. 
                    coming out in the year 2010. His music had heavy themes of depression and drug abuse, and his overall struggle with
                    life. He unfortunately passed away in the year 2018, shortly after the release of his Swimming album. He passed 
                    away due to fentanyl overdose found in the drugs he had been using. The drug dealer that he bought it from had been 
                    selling product like this knowing that it was dangerous and not informing his customers of it. The dealer has now been 
                    sentenced to 10 years in prison.

                    <p>
                        It's depressing to hear about someone so young and talented to be losing their life so early, especially someone 
                        who was already struggling with depression and addiction. He was a very talented individual who created music as an 
                        outlet for his struggles.

    <h2>Final Statements</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently expanding my music taste, meaning there was a lot more artists
        of a lot of different genres that I would've loved to include, but in order 
        to save time and space, I only included the ones that I've been listening to
        for the longest.
