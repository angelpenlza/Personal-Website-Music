                    I am a computer science major at CSUF. 
                    Immediately after highschool, I went to Fullerton Community College, both
                    because I wanted to save money and because I wasn't sure what I wanted to pursue as a major. 
                    I started as an electrical engineer major, but switched my major to computer science after a year.
                    I enjoy this field significantly more, although it is just as, if not even more difficult than the EE path. 
                    In my EE path, I had to take a computer science class as a requirement. I had a friend who was also majoring in CS,
                    and he was struggling with it despite being much more intelligent than I was.
                    Because of this, I decided to study for the class during the summer so that the class wasn't so heavy on me when I took it.
                    I ended up having a lot of fun getting simple programs to run and saw the possible careers that a computer science degree 
                    could lead to, which seemed much more appealing than the electrical engineering jobs.

                    Currently, I work the in the tech area of Target. I've gone through various jobs, all pretty unique from one another. 
                    Aside from Target, I've also worked at Northgate and Raising Canes. I didn't like either of those two jobs, 
                    and Target, although I had a rough start, is probably the best of the three. I am hoping to get a job at CSUF because 
                    I believe that it will be easier to manage.
